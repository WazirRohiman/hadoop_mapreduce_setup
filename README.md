# Hadoop MapReduce Setup

Launch a single node Hadoop cluster using Docker and run MapReduce jobs

Hadoop works best when deployed in a fully distributed mode on a large cluster of networked servers sharing a large volume of data. However, for basic understanding, we will configure Hadoop on a single node.

We will run the WordCount example with an input text and see how the content of the input file is processed by WordCount.
