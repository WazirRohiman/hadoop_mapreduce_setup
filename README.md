# Hadoop MapReduce Setup

Launch a single node Hadoop cluster using Docker and run MapReduce jobs

Hadoop works best when deployed in a fully distributed mode on a large cluster of networked servers sharing a large volume of data. However, for basic understanding, we will configure Hadoop on a single node.

We will run the WordCount example with an input text and see how the content of the input file is processed by WordCount. 

Additionally, this repo will also document the setup of a Dockerized Hadoop nodes to create a cluster which will contain the following nodes

    Namenode
    Datanode
    Node Manager
    Resource manager
    Hadoop history server
